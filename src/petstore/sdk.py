    r"""Moov API: Moov is a platform that enables developers to integrate all aspects of money movement with ease and speed. The Moov API makes it simple for platforms to send, receive, and store money. Our API is based upon REST principles, returns JSON responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes. To learn more about how Moov works at a high level, read our [concepts](https://docs.moov.io/guides/concepts/) guide."""
    access_token: AccessToken
    r"""When making requests to Moov from a browser, you can use OAuth with JSON Web Tokens (JWT).

    Our authentication flow follows the OAuth 2.0 standard. With this endpoint, you'll [create an access token](https://docs.moov.io/guides/quick-start/#create-an-access-token) that you will pass along with API requests or when initializing Moov.js. To generate an authentication token, you’ll need to specify scopes that enable the token to use a specific set of API endpoints. To learn more, read our [scopes guide](https://docs.moov.io/guides/developer-tools/scopes/).
    """
    accounts: Accounts
    r"""[Accounts](https://docs.moov.io/guides/accounts/) represent a legal entity (either a business or an individual) in Moov. You can create an account for yourself or set up accounts for others, requesting different [capabilities](https://docs.moov.io/guides/accounts/capabilities/) depending on what you need to be able to do with that account. You can retrieve an account to get details on the business or individual account holder, such as an email address or employer identification number (EIN).

    Based on the type of account and its requested capabilities, we have certain [verification requirements](https://docs.moov.io/guides/accounts/identity-verification/). To see what capabilities that account has, you can use the [GET capability endpoint](https://docs.moov.io/api/#operation/getCapability). 

    When you sign up for the Moov Dashboard, you will have a **facilitator account** which can be used to facilitate money movement between other accounts. A facilitator account will not show up in your list of accounts and cannot be created via API. To update your facilitator account information, use the settings page of the Moov Dashboard.
    """
    analytics: Analytics
    r"""You can retrieve helpful at-a-glance information about your account by getting metrics on categories such as new accounts, transfer counts, and transfer volume over different time periods. To use this endpoint, you must specify the `/analytics.read` scope."""
    bank_accounts: BankAccounts
    r"""To transfer money with Moov, you’ll need to link a bank account to your Moov account, then verify that account. You can link a bank account to a Moov account by providing the bank account number, routing number, and Moov account ID.

    We require micro-deposit verification to reduce the risk of fraud or unauthorized activity. You can verify a bank account by initiating [micro-deposits](https://docs.moov.io/guides/sources/bank-accounts/#micro-deposit-verification), sending two small credit transfers to the bank account you want to confirm. Note that there is no way to initiate a micro-deposit from your bank of choice. 

    Alternatively, you can link and verify a bank account in one step through an instant account verification token from a third party provider like [Plaid](https://docs.moov.io/guides/sources/bank-accounts/plaid) or [MX](https://docs.moov.io/guides/sources/bank-accounts/mx/). Bank accounts can have the following statuses: `new`, `pending`, `verified`, `verificationFailed`, `errored`. Learn more by reading our guide on [bank accounts](https://docs.moov.io/guides/sources/bank-accounts/).
    """
    capabilities: Capabilities
    r"""Capabilities determine what a Moov account can do. Each capability has specific [verification requirements](https://docs.moov.io/guides/accounts/identity-verification/), depending on risk and compliance standards associated with different account activities. For example, there are more information requirements for a business that wants to charge other accounts than for an individual who simply wants to receive funds. When you request a capability, we list the information requirements for that capability. Once you submit the required information, we need to verify the data. Because of this, a requested capability may not immediately become active. For more detailed information on capabilities and capability IDs, read our [capabilities guide](https://docs.moov.io/guides/accounts/capabilities/)."""
    card_issuing: CardIssuing
    r"""A Moov wallet can serve as a funding source for issuing virtual cards. Note that we currently only issue Discover cards. Virtual cards can then be used to spend funds from the wallet.

    <em> The `card-issuing` and `wallet` capabilities are required to be enabled before any card issuing functionality is available. Moov is in a private beta with select customers for card issuing.</em>
    """
    cards: Cards
    r"""You can link credit or debit cards to Moov accounts. You can use a card as a source for making transfers, which charges the card. To link a card to a Moov account and avoid some of the burden of PCI compliance, use the [card link Moov Drop](https://docs.moov.io/moovjs/drops/card-link). You cannot add a card via the Dashboard. If you're linking a card via API, you must provide Moov with a copy of your PCI attestation of compliance. When testing cards, use the designated [card numbers for test mode](https://docs.moov.io/guides/set-up-your-account/test-mode/#cards). You must contact Moov before going live in production with cards. Read our guide on [cards](https://docs.moov.io/guides/sources/cards/) for more information."""
    disputes: Disputes
    r"""A [dispute](https://docs.moov.io/guides/money-movement/cards/disputes/) is a situation where a cardholder formally questions a transaction on their account with their card issuer. This could be for a number of reasons ranging from billing errors to fraudulent activity or dissatisfactory goods/services. If the dispute is recognized as legitimate, the issuer will reverse the payment (otherwise known as a chargeback)."""
    enrichment: Enrichment
    files: Files
    r"""Files can be used for a multitude of different use cases including but not limited to, individual identity verification and business underwriting. You may need to provide documentation to enable capabilities or to keep capabilities enabled for an account. The maximum file size is 10MB. Each account is allowed a maximum of 10 files. Acceptable file types include csv, jpg, pdf, and png. To learn about uploading files in the Moov Dashboard, read our [file upload guide](https://docs.moov.io/guides/dashboard/accounts/#file-upload)."""
    institutions: Institutions
    r"""Lookup ACH and wire participating financial institutions. We recommend using this endpoint when an end-user enters a routing number to confirm their bank or credit union."""
    payment_methods: PaymentMethods
    r"""[Payment methods](https://docs.moov.io/guides/money-movement/payment-methods/) represent all of the ways an account can move funds to another Moov account. Payment methods are generated programmatically when a card or bank account is added or the status is updated e.g., `ach-debit-fund` will be added as a payment method once the bank account is verified.

    <em>RTP® is not yet generally available on Moov. Contact us for more information.</em>
    """
    representatives: Representatives
    r"""We think of a representative as an individual who can take major actions on behalf of a business. A representative can be the business owner, or anyone who owns 25% or more of the business. Some examples of representatives are the CEO, CFO, COO, or president. We require all business accounts to have valid information for at least one representative. Moov accounts must have verified business representatives before a business account can send funds, collect money from other accounts, or store funds in a wallet. To learn more, read our guide on [business representatives](https://docs.moov.io/guides/accounts/business-representatives/)."""
    transactions: Transactions
    r"""A transaction is a record of a card's activity on a particular Moov account."""
    transfers: Transfers
    r"""A [transfer](https://docs.moov.io/guides/money-movement/) is the movement of money between Moov accounts, from source to destination. Provided you have linked a bank account which has been verified, you can initiate a transfer to another Moov account. All you need to do is note a [paymentMethod](#tag/Payment-methods), the $ amount of the transfer, and a brief description. With Moov, you can also implement transfer groups, allowing you to associate multiple transfers together and run them sequentially. To learn more, read our guide on [transfer groups](https://docs.moov.io/guides/money-movement/transfer-groups/#transfer-statuses)."""
    underwriting: Underwriting
    r"""[Underwriting](https://docs.moov.io/guides/accounts/underwriting) is a tool Moov uses to understand a business’s profile before allowing them to collect funds on our platform. This profile includes information like a description of the company or the merchant’s business model, the industry they operate in, and transaction volume. Through underwriting, we can understand and prevent unnecessary financial risk for Moov and those transacting on our platform. Note that underwriting can be instant, but in some cases make take around 2 business days before approval."""
    wallets: Wallets
    r"""A [Moov wallet](https://docs.moov.io/guides/wallet/) can serve as a funding source as you accumulate funds. You can also use the Moov wallet to:
    - Pre-fund transfers for faster payouts
    - Transfer funds between Moov wallets for instantly available funds

    <em> If you've requested the `send-funds` or `collect-funds` capability, the `wallet` capability will be automatically requested as well. Read more on the [data requirements for wallets here](https://docs.moov.io/guides/accounts/capabilities/#wallet).</em>
