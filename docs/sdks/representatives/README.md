# representatives

## Overview

We think of a representative as an individual who can take major actions on behalf of a business. A representative can be the business owner, or anyone who owns 25% or more of the business. Some examples of representatives are the CEO, CFO, COO, or president. We require all business accounts to have valid information for at least one representative. Moov accounts must have verified business representatives before a business account can send funds, collect money from other accounts, or store funds in a wallet. To learn more, read our guide on [business representatives](https://docs.moov.io/guides/accounts/business-representatives/).

### Available Operations

* [list](#list) - List representatives

## list

A Moov account may have multiple representatives depending on the associated business's ownership and management structure. You can use this method to list all the representatives for a given Moov account. Note that Moov accounts associated with an individual do not have representatives. <br><br> To list representatives, you need to specify the `/accounts/{accountID}/representatives.read` scope.

### Example Usage

```python
import petstore
from petstore.models import operations, shared

s = petstore.Petstore(
    security=shared.Security(
        access_token="",
    ),
)

req = operations.ListRepresentativesRequest(
    account_id='8a645842-73a8-4418-9162-309fb0929921',
)

res = s.representatives.list(req)

if res.representatives is not None:
    # handle response
```
